However, despite the years of debate, exactly how gender quotas affect the competence of elected officials – whether women or men – has rarely been studied.

Our study provides unique insight on quotas, while advancing the research and measurement of competence in political selection. We observe Swedish political organizations and find that quotas can actually increase the overall competence of politicians through the displacement of mediocre male candidates and leaders. Our study finds that:

• In the first election after the quota, the share of competent political leaders serving in the highest ranks increased significantly, while the share of competent junior politicians increased in the following two elections.

• Mediocre leaders tend to resign, or are kicked out, in the wake of
