The Church of England voted Sunday to consider holding special services when a member of the congregation announces a new gender identity or undergoes gender transformation.

The vote took place during the Church of England’s general synod meeting which began Friday. England’s bishops voted 30-2 in favor of the services, which clergymen said would help those who “suffer from transphobia,” the BBC reported Sunday.

The vote called the House of Bishops “to consider providing some nationally commended liturgical materials which may be used in parish churches and chaplaincies to provide a pastoral response to the need of transgender people to be affirmed following their long, distressing, and often complex process of transition.”

The synod also voted Saturday to ban conversion therapy for LGBT Christians, arguing that the Bible does not condemn gender transition or homosexuality.

“As the world listens to us, the world needs to hear us say that LGBT orientation and identity is not a crime,” said the Archbishop of York, Dr. John Sentamu. “LGBT orientation and identity is not a sickness. And LGBT orientation and identity is not a sin.”

Clergy members voted 127-28
