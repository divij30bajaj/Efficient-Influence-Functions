Following a break-in during which their wedding photographs were destroyed, a lesbian couple were told to “move or die”, in letters scrawled across a wall.

Thieves broke into the lesbian couple’s home in Kalamazoo, Michigan, stole items, destroyed the photos and wrote anti-gay slurs on the walls.

Included in the messages written in graffiti on the walls were “move or die”, and other messages.

LGBT rights organisations have urged authorities to treat this as a hate crime, saying it is clear the couple were targeted because they are gay.

Authorities said there are currently no suspects, and that they are unable to pursue them as a hate crime, as Michigan law protects people against crimes based on their “race, color, religion, gender, or national origin”, but not sexual orientation or gender identity.
