GENDER will be removed from resumes submitted to the Bank of Queensland under a new measure aimed at boosting the number of executive women in the company’s ranks.

Concerned that there is an “unconscious bias” working against women in the selection process, the Bank of Queensland is removing all identifying factors on CVs to make sure they pick the best person for the job.

Merit system counterproductive for gender equality

The move will come into effect immediately for all executive roles.

Bank of Queensland chief executive Stuart Grimshaw hopes the move will help to increase the number of female executives.

“On a personal note, I have a son and two daughters and I want to create a positive change within the industry where everyone – regardless of their gender, race, age or physical ability – has the same opportunities to succeed,’’ he said.

BoQ HR general manager Ian Doyle said all identifying factors – name, age, gender, address – would be removed from resumes submitted for senior roles.

“It is a brave approach, but you can’t keep doing the same thing and expect different outcomes,’’ he said.
