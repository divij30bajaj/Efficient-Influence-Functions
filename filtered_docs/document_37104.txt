Recently it has been brought to my attention that campus organizations including the Allies Equality Network, the Student Government Board and the Academic Affairs Committee, are collaborating to introduce gender-neutral bathrooms to certain buildings on campus. Two new gender-neutral bathrooms will be at the McFarland Student Union Building towards the end of the Spring 2015 semester, and within the next few months, the one-person restrooms in Lytle, Rickenbach and deFrancesco will also become gender-neutral.

As a student here at KU who not only has friends who do not identify as either male or female, but who also opposes the idea of publicly assigned gender roles, I think this is a great idea. This proposal will promote an inclusive and open-minded environment in which everyone’s comfort levels, beliefs and identities are respected.

Initially, my female friends and I were concerned that the plan would require women to share bathrooms with men. However, because this plan will only affect the single-stalled restrooms, women’s privacy and safety will not be compromised.

Personally, I feel as though the university setting is one in which ideas and beliefs are to be fostered, discussed, respected and potentially transformed. Something
