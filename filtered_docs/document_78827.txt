Midnight last night was the final, extended deadline for The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation (Clinton Foundation) to file financial reports with the IRS on its operations, including the operations of its affiliated entities, for 2015.

The foundation met the deadline, but its financial filings—like those since 1998, for the foundation’s first year of operations—are “false and materially misleading,” says Charles Ortel, a former Wall Street banker who blew the whistle on stock fraud prior to the 2007-2008 market crash and is the recognized leading expert on the foundation’s financial dealings.

Ortel, who has been investigating the foundation and its operations for the past two years, says he has uncovered “the largest unprosecuted charity fraud in history.” Since May, he has been detailing on Leid Stories the highly irregular and downright illegal practices of the foundation and its multiple affiliated entities.

Continuing to follow the money trail, Ortel has examined the financial statements the foundation filed yesterday. The numbers don’t add up, he says.
