In a groundbreaking move, the new Nepal Constitution has explicitly included rights for LGBT individuals, while stopping short of legalising same-sex marriage.

According to a report by HRC Global and Pink Pages, Nepal has enshrined equal rights and freedom from discrimination in Articles 12, 18 and 42 of the new constitution.

Incredibly, while many western countries have legalised same sex marriage, none have provided for explicit and full anti-discrimination legislation in their constitutions. Thus, Nepal joins South Africa and Ecuador as the third country to provide full protections for LGBT people in its national constitution..

Naturally, it is the first Asian country to provide such protections.

This is Nepalâ€™s first constitution as a federal republic following the dissolution of the 239-year-old monarchy by a parliamentary vote in 2008.

Article 12 states that citizens will be allowed to choose their preferred gender identity on their citizenship document. The choices available are male, female or other.
