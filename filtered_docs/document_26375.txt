The reforms will have significant implications for transgender kids, as some state schools have refused to allow a student to transition because their gender did not match their birth certificate. Chair of Transgender Victoria Brenda Appleton, who also co-chairs the government's LGBTI Taskforce, said the process of changing one's gender should be as simple as changing one's name. "The birth certificate is a fundamental part of your identity ... you won't want to use it if it doesn't contain correct information. "It will make life so much easier ... in cases when you need to go to the bank, renew your driver's license, or offer proof of identity." Ms Appleton is advising the government to allow people to be recorded as male, female, or to fill in their gender identity in a blank space.

The government is yet to provide any detail on how they will consider recording a person's gender. Karyn Walker had to pull her transgender child out of a state school in Melbourne's southeast, after the school would not allow her child to transition, because the gender would be different to the sex recorded on her certificate. It was hurtful for the six-year-old daughter to hear her mother explain to doctors, teachers and other service providers about the child's gender transition
