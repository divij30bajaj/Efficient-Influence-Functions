Rappler's Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr Margarita Holmes. Jeremy has a master's degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in 3 continents, he enrolled in and subsequently gave workshops in work-life balance and gender sensitivity training. He has been training with Dr Holmes for the last 10 years, as co-lecturer and occasionally as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives. Dr Holmes needs no further introduction.

Dear Dr Holmes and Mr Baer,

My husband and I had a whirlwind relationship. We agreed to live together after two months of getting to know each other. I have been married for two years already.

We have a lot of differences:

1. Age - He was 19, I was 26 years old. (I look younger than my age)

2. Religion - He doesn't have a religion; I am Christian

3. Family background - He has a broken family; My family is a normal, happy family
