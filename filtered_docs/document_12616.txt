ST. PAUL, Minn. - A St. Paul public charter school will be developing and revising several gender inclusion guidelines as part of a complaint settlement.

Before the 2015-2016 school year started at Nova Classical Academy, David and Hannah Edwards say they informed the school that their kindergartener was gender non-conforming. They also offered to work with the school on gender inclusivity policies and asked that Nova protect their child from gender-based harassment.

In November 2015, the Edwards formally requested that the school adopt a gender inclusion policy.

In January 2016, the Edwards reported their child was being bullied for wearing pink shoes and choosing to wear the school's girl uniform. That month, the school board agreed that there was a need for a policy and then created a task force to recommend one for board approval.

The Edwards filed a charge of discrimination with the city of St. Paul. In June, the St. Paul Department of Human Rights and Equal Economic Opportunity found probable cause that the school violated the cityâ€™s human-rights ordinance.
