A BRITISH bank has made history by introducing a non-binary option on sign-up forms for people who don't identify as male or female.

From today, customers and employees at Metro Bank can tick a box describing their gender as non-binary and use the title Mx instead of Mr, Mrs, Miss, or Ms when signing up to a new account.

The title of Mx is commonly used by non-binary people and those who don't wish to reveal their gender.

Metro Bank say the decision was triggered by the case of Scottish teen Kaelin Fanish, who told Buzzfeed News earlier this year that they couldn't open a bank account because they don't identify as male or female.
