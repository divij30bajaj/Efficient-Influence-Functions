Former Houston Chronicle reporter Sarah Tressler has filed a gender discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, her attorney announced Thursday.

At a news conference in Los Angeles, attorney Gloria Allred said Tressler was fired from the Chronicle because of her part-time job as an exotic dancer. "Men who are independent contractors are not fired for work done legally," Allred told reporters.

In a one-page EEOC complaint, Tressler wrote that she was terminated "because my prior activity as an adult dancer was not disclosed when I applied for the job. I believe that the stated reason for my termination was pretextual in that I answered the questions that were put to me truthfully in connection with my application for employment. The true reason for my termination was discrimination on account of my gender.''
