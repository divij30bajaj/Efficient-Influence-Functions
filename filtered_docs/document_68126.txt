In a unanimous, bipartisan vote on Tuesday, California lawmakers advanced a bill that would require every single-occupancy bathroom in the state to be relabeled with “all gender” signage, making it clear that none of those spaces are exclusively for men or women. The vote, 14-0, took place in the business and professions committee and the bill will next be considered in the appropriations committee.

The primary sponsor of the bill, San Francisco-area assemblymember Phil Ting, says such an expansive measure has never been passed on the state level, though several cities have taken part in the growing gender-neutral bathroom revolution in recent years, including San Francisco, Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Austin, Texas.

Advocates often emphasize that the change is cheap—less than $50 for a new bathroom sign plus the labor of switching them out—while the benefits can be substantial for transgender and gender non-conforming people, who are often harassed when using sex-segregated facilities. In committee, Ting said passing the measure is a “simple but necessary issue” that affects not only transgender people, but parents accompanying children of a different sex or individuals who have opposite-sex caretakers.
