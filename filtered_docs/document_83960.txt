With regards to the gender question, I advise feminist revolution June 23, 2010

Over on the IEET website, Kris Notaro contemplates the sex distinction. We need to see more on this subject within transhumanism. Reminiscent of Anne Fausto-Sterling’s Sexing the Body, Notaro focuses on biological complications that undermine the binary. The piece charmingly avoids the common pitfall of simplistic genetic determinism. Notaro optimistically concludes that the scientifically demonstrated complexity of gender identity will soon lead to a postgender society. Sadly, I don’t think male supremacy will politely stride off into the sunset. Dudes benefit too much from the privilege. Nor is the scientific establishment universally interested in queering things up. Popular evolutionary psychology appears hellbent on bolstering the binary. I suspect we’ll have to take an old-fashioned approach.

It’s not as if we have the time to wait, anyway. The patriarchy is a global human rights crisis.
