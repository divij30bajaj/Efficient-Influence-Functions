Women are increasingly turning their noses up at the 2016 election, including Democratic women despite the likelihood that their party's nominee will be one of them, according to a new Gallup survey of the gender gap in those closely following the election.

Women have never paid as much attention to the current race as men, but Gallup found that the attention gap has expanded in recent months.

Once just two points apart, in February, the gap is now 13 points and is seen in both Democratic and Republican ranks as men continue to be engaged in the election dominated by news coverage of Republican Donald Trump.

Gallup said that 44 percent of men, compared to 31 percent of women, are paying close attention to the race.

"The gender gap persists within both parties. An aggregated analysis of March and April responses shows that Republican men are eight points more likely than Republican women to be following the election very closely, while Democratic men are 11 points more likely than Democratic women," said Gallup.

"Pure independents — those who do not lean to either party — are following the news less closely than those in either party, regardless of gender, as would be expected. But even with overall lower levels of interest, independent men are significantly more likely than independent women to say
