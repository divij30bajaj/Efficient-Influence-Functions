Ellen Pao leaves court as her sexual bias trial against fomer employer Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byerr continues in San Francisco Thomson Reuters

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Venture capital firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers is seeking to recover about $973,000 in costs from a high profile gender discrimination trial that captivated Silicon Valley, according to a court filing on Thursday.

A jury cleared Kleiner Perkins in March of claims it short-circuited former partner Ellen Pao's career because she is a woman. The trial helped spark a wide discussion about gender at the center of the U.S. technology industry.

Kleiner has offered to waive its legal costs should Pao choose not to appeal, according to firm spokeswoman Christina Lee. Kleiner's costs request includes about $865,000 in expert witness fees, the court filing said.

"We believe that women in technology would be best served by having all parties focus on making progress on the issues of gender diversity outside of continued litigation," Lee said in a statement.

Pao has not yet indicated whether she will appeal. Her attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday.
