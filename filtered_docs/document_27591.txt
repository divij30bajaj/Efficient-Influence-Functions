Dear ultimate community members,

A few weeks ago, the Gender Equity Action Group released a statement of beliefs around gender equity in ultimate. Since releasing our statement, our group has had very positive and encouraging communications with USA Ultimate. In addition to an initial conference call with Tom Crawford and DeAnna Ball, USAU has graciously invited us to join them in Colorado Springs for an in-person conversation about Gender Equity in our sport. Representatives from our group are planning a trip to Colorado post-nationals. We are excited to work together with USAU to promote gender equity and want to gather more information and feedback from our community to take into our meeting with them. We also recognize that while our initial statement focused primarily on Gender Equity in broadcasting, achieving equity in media coverage is just one of many steps our community needs to take in order to move beyond gender bias in our sport.

At Nationals, we’d love to gather to continue an open conversation across all teams and with all players and community members. This will also give us a better sense of how you’re all feeling when the GEAG enters an in-person meeting with USAU.

Friday, September 30th, from 6:30 – 7:30 pm, at the Five
