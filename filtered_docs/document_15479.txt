A new MSN poll for Business Insider found that the majority of men and women still prefer the company of men at work.

And it’s not just men supporting their own gender: One in five men and women said they would rather work with a male colleague.

Perhaps this male confidence also stems from believing in their own success.

Most men in the MSN poll believed that the gender gap is an issue of the past. 40% of men surveyed said that women are treated “very fairly” in the workplace while only 17% of women believed the same. This reinforces a separate study that found 58% of U.S. men in the workforce believed that “all obstacles to gender equality are gone.”

That’s what researchers found in studies on confidence in the workplace: men are more confident —almost unquestioning— in their abilities and more confident that when things go wrong at work, it’s their gender, and not their performance, that’s to blame. As Ladders has previously reported, male leaders have an advantage and are better liked — across generations.
