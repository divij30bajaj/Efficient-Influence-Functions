Transgender Kids: Who Knows Best? will air on BBC Two

A supportive mother of a transgender child has accused the BBC of lying to her in order to get her to appear in a documentary.

Transgender Kids: Who Knows Best?, which will air on Thursday (12 January) at 9pm on BBC Two, is a This World documentary that claims to ask whether parents are ‘right’ to support their children’s gender identity. The BBC has claimed it is more ‘balanced’ than the promotional information appears to show it to be.

The program information gives an interview with Dr Kenneth Zucker, who the documentary filmmakers say ‘lost his job for challenging the new orthodoxy that children know best’.

In fact, Zucker lost his job after being hit with allegations of psychological abuse against minors. His ‘techniques’ were aimed to ‘repair’ the ‘biological’ gender, and told parents to discard of ‘feminine toys’. The Canadian ‘doctor’ was discredited, disgraced and the gender clinic issued an apology to the more than 500 pre-pubescent youth who came into contact with him since he started practicing in the 1970s.
