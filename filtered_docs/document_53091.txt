cishetsnowflake: falloutmagiboy: kirakirakiwielf: cishetsnowflake: kirakirakiwielf: reye-chan: cishetsnowflake: it’s happened, everyone. we’ve come to the point where ableism is now a gender. GIVE ME SOME OF THAT ALCOHOL hey, i haven’t done research into this yet so i may be wrong, but i think it’s pretty likely that someone with autism chose to use these terms; they felt they defined them and they made them comfortable!!! there is no need to shame someone’s gender and orientation because you think they aren’t “real” enough or something - gender and orientation are personal and as long as they aren’t appropriative or hurting anyone, there is nothing wrong with that :/ someone felt these terms would help define them and that should be respected!!! i am not autistic so i haven’t any right to say whether these are okay terms or not, but i am quite sure that they are fine and if anyone wants to correct me on that then please do so!!!! 1. i�
