Women dominated in 7 of 11 areas, yet all we hear about is gender imbalance in STEM.

There are seemingly endless programs and advocates to increase the participation of women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) as a means of addressing the gender imbalance, which is particularly dramatic at the graduate and doctoral levels.

The National Science Foundation has special grant programs. The White House emphasizes the issue. Efforts are made at the elementary and secondary school levels to increase participation by girls.

One of my daughters was a computer science major in college (the only female CS major that year), so Iâ€™m well aware of the extensive outreach to women.

Despite years of concerted efforts, the STEM gender imbalance has barely moved. Men still dominate, by a lot.

But the gender imbalance is equal or even more dramatic in fields dominated by women, as this chart shows (via AEI, h/t Ron Coleman):

AEI continues, Women earned majority of doctoral degrees in 2013 for 5th straight year, and outnumber men in grad school 137.5 to 100

The Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) recently released its annual report recently on US graduate school enrollment and degrees for 2013, and here are some
