In an interview with the publication, Hadid and Malik playfully talk about borrowing each other's clothes, which led to the magazine titling their piece, "Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik are part of a new generation embracing gender fluidity."

"I shop in your closet all the time, don't I?" Hadid says in the article. "Yeah, but same," replies Malik. "What was that T-shirt I borrowed the other day?"

Vogue readers quickly took to social to voice their concerns over the piece, calling the magazine out for not featuring real people who identify as non-binary or gender-fluid. "Think Vogue is a bit confused on what gender fluidity is! Wearing your gf's T-shirt does not make you gender fluid," wrote one Twitter user.

"Is Vogue aware that there r actual, real life, gender fluid people out there," another person wrote.
