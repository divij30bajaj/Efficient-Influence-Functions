Well, let’s do this.

Phyllis Schlafly has passed away. From the New York Times:

Phyllis Schlafly, whose grass-roots campaigns against Communism, abortion and the Equal Rights Amendment galvanized conservatives for almost two generations and helped reshape American politics, died on Monday. She was 92.

Her death was confirmed by the Eagle Forum, the conservative organization she founded in 1975.

The predecessor to Mama Grizzlies will be best remembered for her staunch opposition to a constitutional amendment that “would have expanded women’s rights by barring any gender-based distinctions in federal and state laws.”

She was widely published and politically prominent. Some might argue that her advocacy of traditional gender roles, which she herself seems to have eschewed, kept millions of women from being able to say the same for themselves.

Her death precedes the potential election of the first female president of the United States.

Bye, Phyllis.
