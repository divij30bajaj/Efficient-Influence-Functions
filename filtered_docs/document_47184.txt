- Gov. Jerry Brown signed a measure allowing Californians to identify their gender as "non-binary" on driver's licenses if they don't identify solely as male or female, the latest effort by California to ease barriers for LGBT people.

The bill signed late Sunday was among the last of 977 bills that Brown acted on just before a deadline Sunday night.

At the same time, the Democratic governor vetoed three bills that looked to advance protections for women and signed a measure that could allow for a boost in public parks.

With Brown's signature on SB179, California joins Oregon in allowing a gender-neutral option on driver's licenses and state identification cards. The legislation also makes it easier for people to change their name and gender on other official documents such as birth certificates.

The Democratic governor also signed a separate measure that allows people in prison to ask a court for a name or gender change.

"I have dear friends in San Diego and around the state who have been waiting a long time for this," said Sen. Toni Atkins, a San Diego Democrat who wrote both bills.

Amid a growing national conversation about gender identity, California has banned unnecessary travel by state employees doing government work to states deemed hostile to LGBT people and
