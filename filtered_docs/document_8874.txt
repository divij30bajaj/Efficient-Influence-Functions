Scottish Transgender Alliance has filed a petition with the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service urging them to work with trans equality groups

Thousands have signed a petition demanding Scotland’s courts not jail people if they do not tell their sex partners they are trans.

The Scottish Transgender Alliance asked people to sign a petition asking the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) to urgently work with equality groups.

It comes after Chris Wilson, 25, pled guilty in court after he was accused of failing to tell two girls his gender history and real age.

He will be trialed this Friday (5 April), where he will likely face jail. Wilson is already on the sex offender’s register for life.

Over 2,400 people signed the petition, addressing their concern trans people could risk imprisonment for not telling their sexual partners their gender history.

Writing to the Lord Advocate, the STA said: ‘We consider it essential that trans people’s right to privacy about their gender history be upheld in all areas of their lives.

‘They must not be placed in fear of imprisonment simply for non-disclosure of their gender reassignment status to a sexual partner.’
